Running Docker
==============

Our dependencies are met, the environment setup, and the configuration files
configured; Now we're ready to run Docker. From your institution configuration
directory (where the ``docker-compose.yml`` file is), run::

    $ sudo -E docker-compose up -d

.. note::
    The ``-d`` flag daemonizes the containers. If you remove it the output from
    every container will be attached to your terminal. This can be useful for
    debugging.

.. note::
    The ``-E`` flag on sudo preserves the existing environment variables. This
    is needed as we use the `OCS_CONFIG_DIR` variable within the docker-compose
    file.

You can confirm the running state of the containers with the ``docker ps``
command::

    $ bjk49@grumpy:~$ sudo docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                                COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                      NAMES

This example shows all the containers running at Yale at the time of this
writing.

.. note::

    Since all the OCS Agents are configured to run in containers (which is our
    recommendation for running your system), there is no additional startup of OCS
    Agents. Previously these were either started individually by calling the agent
    script in a terminal, or using the `ocsbow` tool.

    If your system is still setup to use these methods you can move to the
    Docker configuration by adding the required Agents to your docker-compose
    configuration and moving the Agent configurations in the ocs config file to a
    docker host block.

Using Docker
------------
Many users may not be familiar with using Docker. Here are some useful tips for
interacting with docker.

Viewing Logs
````````````
Each container has its own logs to which the output from the program running
inside the container is written. The logs can be viewed with::

    $ sudo docker logs <container name>

If you want to follow the logs (much like you would ``tail -f`` a file) you can run::

    $ sudo docker logs -f <container name>

Updating Containers
```````````````````
If you have made changes to the docker compose configuration you need to update
your containers by running the up command again::

    $ sudo -E docker-compose up -d

This will rebuild any containers that have either been updated or depend on one
which has updated.

To update a single service only you can run::

    $ docker-compose stop <service name>
    $ docker-compose up <service name>

Where you need to replace ``<service name>`` with the name of the service you
have configured in your docker-compose configuration file.

Restarting Containers
`````````````````````
If need to just restart a container, and haven't made any changes to your
docker-compose configuration file you can do so with::

    $ sudo docker-compose restart <container name>

Shutting Down All Containers
````````````````````````````
All the containers started with Compose can be stopped with::

    $ sudo docker-compose down
